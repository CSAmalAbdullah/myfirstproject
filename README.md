This is a beginner-level project where I predict the number of medals countries will win in the Olympics using historical data. The project is meant for learning and practicing AI & Machine Learning.

Steps in the Project:
	1.	Import and explore the dataset.
	
 2.	Analyze patterns in historical Olympic data.
	
 3.	Prepare the data for modeling.
	
 4.	Build a prediction model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest).
	
 5.	Evaluate the model with simple metrics like MAE or RMSE and visualize results.

Note:
This project is educational and simplified. It helped me practice data analysis and predictive modeling as a beginner.
